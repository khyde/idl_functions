; NAME:
;		PLOT_TRANSECTS
;
; PURPOSE:;
;		This Program Plots several Transects  READS and PLOTS the Contour Positions generated by IDL's CONTOUR program.
;
; CATEGORY:
;		PLOT
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;		Result = PLOT_TRANSECTS('PATH AND NAME OF FILE GENERATED BY IDL'S CONTOUR PROGRAM WITH PATH_FILENAME SPECIFIED')

; INPUTS:
;		CONTOUR_FILE:	Name of file generated by IDL'S CONTOUR routine and when specifiying PATH_FILENAME= ' '

; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;		PATH_INFO:	Contour Path Information in a structure obtained from CONTOUR and specifying PATH_INFO
;		PATH_XY:    Contour coordinate information from CONTOUR and specifying PATH_XY.
;
;		STRUCT:	May input a Structure previously read by READ_CONTOURS
;
;		VALUES:	The contour levels to plot
;
;		DELIM:  The delimiter to use to extract the x,y positions from these tags in the CONTOUR_FILE structure
;						(the default delimiter is ';'.
;						If you first obtain a CONTOUR_FILE structure using READ_CONFILE and specify a different delimiter then
;						set DELIM to that value for this routine to properly plot the delimited x,y positions in the STRUCT.
;
;		_EXTRA: Any extra keywords that you would like to pass to the PLOT routine
;
; OUTPUTS:
;		Plots the x,y positions of the contours on the graphic device
;
;	PROCEDURE:
; EXAMPLE:
;
;	NOTES:
;	Note that the idl structure written using keyword PATH_FILENAME does NOT have the OFFSET Tag, but PATH_INFO returned by
;	IDL CONTOUR Routine DOES have OFFSET TAG.
